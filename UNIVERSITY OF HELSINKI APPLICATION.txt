a. What are your motives to apply for the Master's Programme in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki?
(1000 character limit)

Ever since I was a child I loved maths, so when it was time to choose what to study in university, maths was the obvious choice, and although I had no idea what studying maths was like, as I went on with my studies I realized that it was exactly what I loved. During my time in university I joined undergraduate research projects in a few different areas of maths, and even though it was really hard to grasp concepts of advanced math I had never heard before, it made me realize how diverse maths really is, and how amazing it is to study it. As time went on, my love for math grew stronger and I knew that I wanted to persue a career in maths and eventually become a researcher and professor, so joining a master's program is the clear next step in this journey.
When it came to choosing Helsinki, as Finland is a leader in education worldwide, the University of Helsinki would be an incredible place to continue my maths journey, but that's not the sole reason, Finland also interests me for other reasons, as someone who loves learning about other cultures and languages, I became very interested in learning the Finnish language, even though it has the reputation to be really hard, I find it very interesting and beautiful.

b. How do your previous studies enable you to succeed in the studies of the Master's Programme in Mathematics and Statistics?
(500 character limit)

For my classes I had to study many different areas of maths, including analysis, geoemtry, algebra and topology. And as mentioned in the previous question, I took part in different undergraduate research projects, in areas such as differential equations and algebra. I have also joined a master's level class in Rn analysis. Those combined provided me with deeper understanding of advanced mathematics and some experience of what it feels like to study maths outside of a basic curriculum

c. How do the studies of the Master's Programme in Mathematics and Statistics complement and broaden your previous studies?

(potentially mention research group here)

d. Specify how studying in the Master's Programme in Mathematics and Statistics relates to your career objectives and what you wish to achieve by completing your master's degree. 
(500 character limit)

After I finish my master's I would like to join a PhD programme to eventually pursue a career as a researcher and professor of mathematics. The University of Helsinki is the perfect environment for that, mathematical knowledge is always best to be shared and I would be surrounded by students who share the same desire of working in the field. And also there are many professors whose areas of research align with what I would like to continue studying.

(453 characters, good reasons, just need to improve the flow)

e. Outline your academic interests in the chosen field, i.e. indicate what you see as being the topic of your Master's thesis and how it relates to this Master's Programme.
(500 character limit)

My chosen area of study is analysis, for my bachelor's thesis, I'm currently studying Sobolev spaces and weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. My current idea for my master's thesis is to continue studying (functional) analysis and possibly keep on studying the Navier-Stokes equations. Lately I have also been interested in Harmonic analysis, which is something that's not included in the curriculum of many universities, but it is something I can study at the University of Helsinki.

f. Draw up a study plan. How will you complete your Master's studies in two years’ time?
(2000 character limit)

My choices would obviously depend on the courses offered in each semester but the main idea is as follows

For my first semester, I would like to take some core classes in my chosen area, such as real analysis, functional analysis or partial differential equations, but I also think it's of extreme importance to take courses outside of one's chosen area, for me, that would mean taking a class in topology or differential geometry.

For my second semester, I would continue with a focus in analysis, this time with some more advanced topics like spectral theory, Fourier analysis or complex analysis and continue with courses that include a second part such as functional analysis and if possible still take a class in area outside of analysis to broaden my knowledge, because a good mathematician doesn't just study one specific subject.

For my third semester, I want to be able to start my master's thesis and take courses that would be beneficial for the thesis, as of my current plan that includes courses like Sobolev spaces, harmonic analysis. I hope to work closely with an advisor who shares my interest in analysis, which will provide me with valuable guidance and feedback throughout the thesis process.

For my last semester, I hope to have achieved all necessary credits so that the only thing left is to finish my thesis and I can fully focus on that, but if necessary I would continue taking advanced analysis courses. If my thesis work allows, I would also like to attend advanced seminars or participate in research discussion groups, as I believe that's an extremely important part of being a maths student.

Scholarship question
How will your studies at the University of Helsinki contribute to the advancement of knowledge in your chosen field of study? Is the Master's Programme in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki your first choice? If so, please explain why. How would the scholarship improve your commitment and contribution to the degree programme?
(3000 character limit)

(answer first question)
The University of Helsinki is my first choice for a master's degree, its wide range of advanced courses in analysis, including, but not limited to, Sobolev spaces and harmonic analysis, which align with my research interests, incredible professors, and many possible research group opportunities in the field, those combined make the University of Helsinki a clear first choice for me. Not only that, Finland is an amazing country and it would be a great opportunity to be able to live and study there.
The scholarship is a big necessity for me, affording the tuition fee is a big challenge for me and my family. So getting the scholarship would 





(for one of the questions mention something like. i would love to join a research group if posible)
(the groups have a strong national and international presence
many senior researchers visit the university)
